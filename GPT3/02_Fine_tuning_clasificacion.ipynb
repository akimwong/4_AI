As outsiders, it\\'s fine for \\nus to say, \"He should hire a different coach.\"  In fact, he has talked about\\ndoing so in the past.

He needs to, as the papers say, \"get that monkey off his back.\"\\nSo it becomes a matter not of intelligence, but of pride.  Is it foolish\\nto let pride stand in the way of sound logic?  Perhaps, but we\\'re all\\na little that way from time to time.  I think eventually he\\'ll step down\\nfrom behind the bench and concentrate on his GM duties, and the team will\\nimprove as a result.\\n\\nI think his coaching duties take away time he might have otherwise spent\\non GM work.

He fans on 25% of goal mouth feeds, but he still has \\n36 goals after a terrible start and has been an examplary (sp?) team captain\\nthroughout a tough couple of seasons. Honorable mention: Nick Kypreos and\\nMark Janssens. Probably more appropriate in the unsung heroes category than\\nMVP, but Kypreos (17 goals, 320+ PIM) has been the hardest working player on\\nthe team and Janssens is underrated as a defensive center and checker. I guess\\nI place a greater emphasis on hard work than skill when determining value.\\n\\nBiggest surprise: Geoff Sanderson. He had 13 goals and 31 points last season\\nas a center, then moved to left wing and has so far put up 45 goals and 80+\\npoints. He now has a new Whaler record 21 power play goals, most all coming\\nfrom the right wing faceoff circle, his garden spot. Honorable mention: Andrew\\nCassels and Terry Yake. The kiddie quartet of Sanderson, Poulin, Nylander, and\\nPetrovicky have been attracting the most attention, but Cassels is just 23\\nand will score close to 90 points this season. He has quite nicely assumed the\\nrole of number one center on the team and works very well with Sanderson. Yake\\nbounced around the minors for a number of seasons but is still 24 and will put\\nup about 20 goals and 50 points this season. Yake, like Sanderson, started\\nperforming better offensively once he was converted from center to wing, \\nalthough lefty Sanderson went to the left wing and righty Yake went to the\\nright side.\\n\\nBiggest disappointment: Hands down, John Cullen. Cullen had a disasterous 77\\npoint season last year, his first full season after The Trade. Cullen started\\nthe season off of summer back surgery, and fell flat on his face (appropriate,\\nsince he spent all of his Whaler career flat on his ass, and whining about it).\\nCullen scored just 9 point on 19 games, was a clubhouse malcontent, commanded\\nthe powerplay to a 9% success percentage (>21% with Sanderson), and sulked his\\nway out of town. Worst of all, his 4 year, $4M contract had three years left\\nto run, so no one would give up any more than the 2nd round draft pick the \\nMaple Leafs offered to Hartford. Honorable mention: Steve Konroyd, also subpar\\nafter signing a 3 year, $2.1M contract; Eric Weinrich, who showed flashes of\\ncompetence, but overall has played poorly; Jim McKenzie, who was a much better\\nhockey player two seasons ago than he is now; and Frank Pietrangelo, who only\\nseemed to play well when Sean Burke was out for an extended period and he got\\nto make a number of starts in a row.\\n\\n-SG (a real live Hartford Whalers season ticket holder)\\n-steveg@cadkey.com\", 'completion': 'hockey'}, {'prompt': 'From: kfrank@magnus.acs.ohio-state.edu (Kevin D Frank)\\nSubject: NHL Team Items...\\nNntp-Posting-Host: top.magnus.acs.ohio-state.edu\\nOrganization: The Ohio State University\\nLines: 17\\n\\nI live in the desolate MidWest (as far as hockey is concerned) and our \"sports\"\\nstores around here carry VERY LITTLE hockey stuff, except for San Jose, Tampa\\nBay, L.A., Pittsburgh, and if you\\'re lucky Chicago.\\n\\nI would like to know if anyone knows of any m,ail order, phone order stores that\\nI might be able to get in contact with.

If he was as great a GM as you claim\\n\\nI think you missed one of my points there.  It takes *more* than a great\\nGM to win a stanley cup, even once.  Some of the guys on the list you\\ngave earlier never won one.  I agree that you and I could probably argue\\nback and forth for days to no avail about who is the best GM in hockey-\\nthat is a matter of opinion, and who is to say my opinion is any better \\nthan yours or yours than mine?  But the point of my *original* original\\npost (if not well stated) was that Murray has the GM abilities but not\\nthe coaching abilities.  Which leads to below:\\n\\n>and he was as poor a coach as you claim- he would have been intelligent\\n>enough to hire the coach to push the team to the next level of success.\\n\\nI think at this point there\\'s a personal, emotional element involved here\\nwhich transcends Murray\\'s logical thought.  As outsiders, it\\'s fine for \\nus to say, \"He should hire a different coach.\"  In fact, he has talked about\\ndoing so in the past.  But, the press (here in Detroit, at least) has so\\nbuilt up this business about Murray never getting past the second round of\\nthe playoffs as a coach, that I think he has taken it upon himself to \\nprove to the world that he *is* capable of coaching a team past the second\\nround.  He needs to, as the papers say, \"get that monkey off his back.\"\\nSo it becomes a matter not of intelligence, but of pride.  Is it foolish\\nto let pride stand in the way of sound logic?  Perhaps, but we\\'re all\\na little that way from time to time.  I think eventually he\\'ll step down\\nfrom behind the bench and concentrate on his GM duties, and the team will\\nimprove as a result.\\n\\nI think his coaching duties take away time he might have otherwise spent\\non GM work.  In that sense, once he steps down as coach, we\\'ll see how\\ngood of a GM he really is.\\n\\n>But Murray is an average (unspectacular) NHL coach and a pretty good GM\\n>so none of this is true anyway.\\n\\nI may not agree with everything you\\'ve said, but it\\'s been fun discussing\\nit with you.\\n\\n>Gregmeister\\n\\n--Randy\\n\\n###\\n\\n', 'completion': ' hockey'}\n",
