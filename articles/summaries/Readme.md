# Fine-tuning GPT-3 for Helpdesk Automation: A Step-by-Step Guide
(Learn how to train GPT-3 on your internal database of helpdesk requests and answers using Python and the OpenAI API)

## Context of GPT-3

### 1. Pre-training
- GPT-3 has been pre-trained on a large text dataset to understand the nuances of human speech and produce highly coherent and contextually appropriate text.
- This pre-training has provided GPT-3 with a strong foundation in language comprehension, allowing the model to produce highly coherent texts with minimal fine-tuning. One of GPT-3’s most significant advantages is its ability to generate human-like text with minimal training data.
- However, one of the major disadvantages of GPT-3 is that it necessitates a large amount of data and computational resources, both of which are costly and difficult for some users to obtain.

### 2. Fine-tuning vs retraining
- It is necessary to distinguish between fine-tuning and re-training a language model.
- Retraining is the process of training a model from scratch with new data, whereas fine-tuning is the process of adjusting the parameters of a previously trained model to new data.
- <b> Fine-tuning GPT-3 for specific tasks is much faster and more efficient than completely re-training a model. </b>
- Fine-tuning has some drawbacks, such as the risk of over-fitting and the fact that the best results are not always obtained.

### 3. Limitations of GPT-3

- GPT-3 has a tendency to over-fit, so it is critical to monitor the performance of your fine-tuned model and make adjustments as needed.
- It should also be noted that GPT-3 is not a general AI model; rather, it can only perform specific tasks based on its training.

## How to fine-tune GPT-3 for your needs?

- The amount of data required to fine-tune GPT-3 will vary depending on the task and the quality of the data. 
- However, for fine-tuning to be effective, at least a few hundred examples of labeled data are recommended. For example, if you’re fine-tuning a text classification model, you’ll need labeled text data.
- It’s worth noting that fine-tuning GPT-3 on your own data can be computationally expensive, so a powerful machine is recommended.
- <b>A part that is equally important as quantity is QUALITY! </b> The higher the quality and diversity of your data, the better your model will work. A diverse set of examples is needed to ensure that the model can generalize well to new examples. 
- A good mix of positive and negative examples is also needed to ensure that the model can handle a variety of inputs.

## 6 Steps to have a fine-tuned GPT-3 model for a Helpdesk 2.0

1.	Collect your data: Capture your internal database. This usually means splitting the requests and responses into separate text fields and possibly adding additional fields such as labels or tags.
2.	Prepare your dataset: You will need to pre-process your dataset by cleaning it, tokenizing it, and creating a vocabulary. This will ensure that your dataset is properly formatted for fine-tuning with GPT-3.
3.	Build the model: Once your dataset is ready, you can train GPT-3 on it using the fine-tuning API. Typically, you will need to specify the model architecture, the dataset, and other parameters such as the number of training trials.
4.	Fine-tuning: After training the model, you can fine-tune it by adjusting the parameters and training it again with your data set. This enables the model to learn and improve its performance by discovering patterns in your data.
5.	Evaluate the model: After fine-tuning, it is critical to evaluate your model’s performance by testing it on a verified dataset or monitoring its performance on real-world tasks.
6.	Deploy the model: Once you’re happy with the performance of your model, you can integrate it into your application.

## 7. Using the Code

- The <b>prompt</b> variable is where you would insert your dataset.
- The <b>completions</b> variable is used to specify the fine-tuning parameters. 
- The <b>engine</b> parameter specifies which version of GPT-3 to use, the prompt parameter specifies the fine-tuning data, 
- The <b>max_tokens</b> parameter specifies the maximum number of tokens to generate, 
- The <b>n</b> parameter specifies the number of completions to generate
- The <b>temperature</b> parameter controls the level of randomness in the generated text.

# How to Fine-Tune GPT-3 Model for Named Entity Recognition

## Introduction
- One of the most significant advantages of fine-tuning is that it enables “few-shot learning,” whereby the model can intuit the task you are trying to perform based on just a few examples.
- once a model has been fine-tuned, you no longer need to provide examples in the prompt, resulting in cost savings and enabling lower-latency requests.

## Preparing Training Data
- Is an essential step in fine-tuning GPT-3, as it teaches the model the desired output. 
- <b>The data must be in the form of a JSONL document</b>, where each line is a prompt-completion pair corresponding to a training example. 
- This format is easy to work with, and you can use the CLI data preparation tool to convert your data into this format quickly.
- When designing your <b>prompts and completions for fine-tuning, it is essential to remember that it is different from prompt engineering</b>. 
- For fine-tuning, <b>each training example generally consists of a single input example and its associated output</b>. This eliminates the need to give detailed instructions or include multiple examples in the same prompt reducing the cost significantly.
