# Fine-tuning GPT-3 for Helpdesk Automation: A Step-by-Step Guide
(Learn how to train GPT-3 on your internal database of helpdesk requests and answers using Python and the OpenAI API)

## Context of GPT-3

### 1. Pre-training
- GPT-3 has been pre-trained on a large text dataset to understand the nuances of human speech and produce highly coherent and contextually appropriate text.
- This pre-training has provided GPT-3 with a strong foundation in language comprehension, allowing the model to produce highly coherent texts with minimal fine-tuning. One of GPT-3’s most significant advantages is its ability to generate human-like text with minimal training data.
- However, one of the major disadvantages of GPT-3 is that it necessitates a large amount of data and computational resources, both of which are costly and difficult for some users to obtain.

### 2. Fine-tuning vs retraining
- It is necessary to distinguish between fine-tuning and re-training a language model.
- Retraining is the process of training a model from scratch with new data, whereas fine-tuning is the process of adjusting the parameters of a previously trained model to new data.
- <b> Fine-tuning GPT-3 for specific tasks is much faster and more efficient than completely re-training a model. </b>
- Fine-tuning has some drawbacks, such as the risk of over-fitting and the fact that the best results are not always obtained.

### 3. Limitations of GPT-3

- GPT-3 has a tendency to over-fit, so it is critical to monitor the performance of your fine-tuned model and make adjustments as needed.
- It should also be noted that GPT-3 is not a general AI model; rather, it can only perform specific tasks based on its training.

## How to fine-tune GPT-3 for your needs?

- The amount of data required to fine-tune GPT-3 will vary depending on the task and the quality of the data. 
- However, for fine-tuning to be effective, at least a few hundred examples of labeled data are recommended. For example, if you’re fine-tuning a text classification model, you’ll need labeled text data.
- It’s worth noting that fine-tuning GPT-3 on your own data can be computationally expensive, so a powerful machine is recommended.
- <b>A part that is equally important as quantity is QUALITY! </b>
- The higher the quality and diversity of your data, the better your model will work. A diverse set of examples is needed to ensure that the model can generalize well to new examples. 
- A good mix of positive and negative examples is also needed to ensure that the model can handle a variety of inputs.
